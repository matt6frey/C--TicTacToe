# C# TicTacToe

Here is a quick little project in C#. The program is a terminal-based game. Players can set their names and play as many games as the like before calling it quits. There is a Wins/Loss tracker included.

If you want to play or test this game out, download the bin folder, and the file: `TicTacToe.exe` in the `Release` folder.

Cheers! :beer:
